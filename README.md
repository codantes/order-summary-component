### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
- I started out with putting all the assets and content on the webpae without any styling.
- I a made variables according to the design I was provided with, to make design more flexible in case I needed to change anything.
- I started by using flexbox for laying out every element. I started out with mobile first.
- After basic styling and laying out I added all the hover styles 
- In the end I added media queries on a breakpoint of 600px for bigger screens.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- First thing I learnt that I should choose my developer tools according to my prefrences. I found out that mozilla dev tools helped me much more than recommended chrome dev tools.
- I am starting to grasp the concept of media queries and responsiveness much better. I still improve upon choosing the right breakpoints of my design.
- I am getting an understanding of user experience. I understanding the design choices. 
- I am able to use flexbox very effectively now. My skills with layout has improved. 

### Useful resources

- [media queries on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6370690/media-queries-how-to-target-desktop-tablet-and-mobile) -This article helped me to figure out right media queries for the this project. I didn't go exactly as per the specifications of the design for the responsiveness because I thought this would work better.
